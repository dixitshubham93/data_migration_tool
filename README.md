A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

This project is a powerful data migration utility that transfers collections from a MongoDB database into a structured, normalized MySQL schema. It intelligently handles:

Primitive types, nested objects, and arrays

Automatic table creation based on inferred data types

Relationship detection and foreign key constraints

Normalization by separating nested structures into related tables

Itâ€™s designed for developers, data engineers, or teams who need to move NoSQL data to relational systems for reporting, analytics, or compliance purposes.
